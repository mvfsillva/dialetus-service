## Creating new test case

- All tests cases should be inside `test` folders
- When creating a end-to-end test case, always think about the user and the output of an action
- Create successful and failure test cases
- If you have a reusable function, you can create it inside `suites` folders

## Submit a PR when you are ready

Finally submit a PR with your new test case.

## Celebrate! 🎉
